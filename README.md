# Library Management System

This is a simple library management system implemented in TypeScript. It allows users to add books, borrow books, return books, and view available books.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PranayChavhan/LibraryManagementSystem.git
   cd LibraryManagementSystem
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Run tests:
   ```
   npm test
   ```

4. Build and run the project:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

The `src/index.ts` file contains example usage of the LibraryService. You can modify this file or create a new one to interact with the library system.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code
  - `models/`: Data models
  - `services/`: Business logic
  - `index.ts`: Entry point of the application
- `tests/`: Contains test files
- `package.json`: Project configuration and dependencies
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript configuration
- `jest.config.js`: Jest test runner configuration
